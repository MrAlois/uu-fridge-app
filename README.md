# Food Rescue Fridge

This project, part of our coursework at Unicorn University, demonstrates how to create web applications using the Hilla framework, which is a powerful combination of Spring Boot for backend services and React for the frontend interface. This is my first project using Hilla, having previously worked with uug05, another favored framework at Unicorn University.


## Why Hilla (SpringBoot + React + TailwindCSS)?

1. **Fast Iteration** - Hilla's hot-reload feature allows for quick changes without needing server restarts, thus improving developer experience and efficiency.

2. **Strong Ecosystems** - Both Spring Boot and React have a wealth of resources, libraries, and support communities that can help you solve almost any problem you encounter during development.

3. **Variety of middleware** - Spring Boot's Spring ecosystem has a multitude of middleware options to choose from, making it easy to extend your application with various services.

4. **Reusability and Modularity** - React allows us to create modular and reusable components, leading to clean and maintainable codebases.

Even though SpringBoot with Thymeleaf and uu framework has served us well for previous projects, it's always good to master more tools and to be able to choose the best for each job.

## Prerequisites

- Java SDK 21
- Node.js v14+ and npm package manager
- IntelliJ Idea or any preferred IDE with Jakarta EE, Spring Data JPA, Spring MVC, Lombok, and Kotlin support.

## Installing and Running

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/MrAlois/uu-fridge-app.git`
2. Open the cloned project in your preferred IDE.
3. Update project dependencies using npm with `npm install`
4. To start the Spring Boot application, run `./gradlew bootRun` in the root directory of your projec (or use Spring Boot run config in IDEA Ultimate).
